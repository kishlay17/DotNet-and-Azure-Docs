Azure function = Event+Code

Use: 
Time--Run a bnackground task on regular schedule
data--process messages in a queue items in blob storage
Web--respond to a HTTP request or webhook

Azure VM,
Azure cloud service,
Azure web Apps and web jobs all these can do the same work as Azure function
then Why Function??

web job act as a background process in same server of web app
Basis Of Azure Functio is Web job
Lighest edition of Azure app service family

Simplified programming model
  just the code to respond to the event
  No boilerplate
  only code that focus on business requirements

Azure VM,
Azure cloud service,
Azure web Apps and web jobs all needs atleast one  servervcontineously running
while
for Azure function we have option to pay as you go only(means if there is no message ever came in queue then  we dont have to pay)

Third party application meets many of the common need of application but 
still we ned to do something as a trigger of event fire (logging, sending email or full text searching or taking payment) 
in that case we can use Azure function and microdoft will worry about the server and their scaling
as--Function as a service(FAAS)

Monoliothic architecture--> same server doing everything then it becomes hard to change the coding environment
using Azure function we are decomposing Monolithic Architectur. microservices takes to nanoservices using Azure functions

group of Zaure functions is Function App.
